=Motivation=

The purpose of the rocket.selection package is to expose in a browser independent manner the ability to work with selections. A selection is what happens when the user of a web page drags the mouse over some text with the browser responding by showing the selection  with reversed colours.

=The solution=
The selection module provides a singleton which in turn may be used to manipulate or discover more about a selection that exists on the current page.

Most of the methods are self explanatory.

Global selection methods (they always work).
|| *method* || *comments* ||
|| Selection.getSelection() || Fetches the Selection singleton. ||
|| Selection.disableTextSelection() || Disable text selection for the entire document. ||
|| Selection.disableTextSelection(Element) || Disable text selection for all children of the given elements. ||
|| Selection.enableTextSelection() || Enable text selection for the entire document. ||
|| Selection.enableTextSelection(Element) || Enable text selection for all children of the given elements. ||
|| Selection.clearAnySelectedText() || Clears any selection ||

The table below lists functionality available upon valid selection.
|| *method* || *comments* ||
|| isEmpty() || Will return true if no selection is present ||
|| clear() || Clears the current selection ||
|| extract() || Removes or *cuts* the selected content from the visible document and makes it the child of a new element. ||
|| delete() || Cuts the selection from the document ||
|| surround( Element element ) || Inserts the given element into the dom so that it is a child of the given element and yet contains the selected area. ||
|| getStart() || Get the start of a selection ||
|| setStart(SelectionEndPoint) || Positions the start of a selection ||
|| getEnd() || Get the end of a selection ||
|| setEnd(SelectionEndPoint) || Positions the end of a selection ||

  * `rocket.selection.client.SelectionEndPoint` - The start and end of a selection (if one 
is present) are defined by a text node and an character offset within that node.

==Potential use cases==
Most of the selection functionality can be used to write a simple rich text (html) editor.
  * The Selection.delete() method may be used to delete whatever the user has selected.
  * The Selection.surround(Element) may be used to apply a style to whatever has selected after updating the Element's inline style.
  * The Selection.extract() may be used to cut a selection. Pasting merely involves adding the returned element to somewhere else in the dom.

=Getting started=

After downloading and unzipping the download the last step required is to inherit the `rocket.selection.Selecton` module.

For further examples refer to the unit demo. The demo is interactive and prompts the user to perform or verify each of the capabilities.
